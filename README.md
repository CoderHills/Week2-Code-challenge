# Event Guest List Manager

A simple web app to manage an event guest list using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  
Add guests, mark their RSVP status, and remove them — all dynamically without page reload.

## Features

- Add guest names via input form
- Display guest list dynamically
- Remove guests with a delete button
- Limit guest list to 10 guests (alerts if exceeded)
- Toggle RSVP status (Attending / Not Attending)

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Enter a guest's name in the input field.
3. Click "Add Guest" to add them to the list.
4. Use the "Mark Attending/Not Attending" button to toggle RSVP status.
5. Use the "Remove" button to delete a guest.
6. You can add up to 10 guests — trying to add more will show an alert.
